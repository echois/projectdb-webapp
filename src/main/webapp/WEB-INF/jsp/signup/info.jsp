  <h2>Get started on the Auckland NeSI cluster of the Centre for eResearch</h2>

  <p>Getting started on the Auckland NeSI cluster involves the following 3 steps:</p>

  <table cellpadding="10">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td valign="top"><img src="<%=request.getContextPath()%>/pics/create_account.png" /></td>
        <td valign="top"><b>1. Request an account</b><br> Provide us with some basic information about
          yourself.<br> A staff member of the Centre for eResearch will verify your request, and set up an account
          for you.<br> Once the account has been created, you will receive a notification e-mail with basic
          instructions on how to use the Auckland NeSI cluster.<br></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td valign="top"><img src="<%=request.getContextPath()%>/pics/survey.png" /></td>
        <td valign="top"><b>2. Tell us why you would like to use the Auckland NeSI cluster</b><br> If you are
          new to the Auckland NeSI cluster, please tell us why you would like to use the Auckland NeSI cluster for your
          research.<br> You will be guided through a survey with a few questions about the computing environment
          you are currently using.<br></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td valign="top"><img src="<%=request.getContextPath()%>/pics/create_project.png" /></td>
        <td valign="top"><b>3. Tell us what you want to do</b><br> Provide us with some information about the
          research project you want to use the cluster for.<br> You can either join a project which is already
          registered with the Auckland NeSI cluster, or request a new project to be created.<br> A staff member of
          the Centre for eResearch will set up access to the project directory on the cluster filesystem for you.<br>
          Once the access has been set up, you will receive a notification e-mail with basic instructions on how to
          access your project directory.<br></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>Once your account and project has been set up, you will be able to submit jobs on the Auckland NeSI cluster.</p>
